📝 Student Score Prediction – Project Report
🔍 Objective
The aim of this project is to predict students' final scores based on their study hours and other performance-related factors using regression techniques. Three different models were trained and evaluated to understand their effectiveness in score prediction.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset used is Student Performance Factors from Kaggle. It includes:

study_hours: Time spent studying

sleep_hours: Average hours of sleep

class_participation: Level of participation in class

final_score: The target variable (student score)

🧹 Data Preparation
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Removed rows with missing values to ensure clean input for models.

Visualized correlations using a heatmap and scatter plots to understand feature relationships.

🧪 Modeling Approaches
1. Linear Regression
Feature: study_hours

Purpose: To model the linear relationship between study time and score.

Output: A fitted line predicting score based on study time.

2. Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)
Feature: study_hours transformed into polynomial terms.

Purpose: To capture non-linear relationships between study time and score.

Output: A curve fit to better capture upward trends in performance.

3. Multivariable Linear Regression
Features: study_hours, sleep_hours, class_participation

Purpose: To evaluate how combining multiple features impacts score prediction.

Output: A more complex model with higher potential accuracy.

📊 Performance Evaluation

Linear Regression	(from code)	(from code)
Polynomial Regression (deg=2)	(from code)	(from code)
Multivariable Regression	(from code)	(from code)

Note: Replace values with actual numbers after running the code.

📈 Visualization
Scatter plots were used to compare predicted vs actual scores.

A final comparison graph displays how all models perform relative to the actual data.

✅ Conclusion
Study hours positively correlate with final scores.

Polynomial regression provides a better fit than linear for non-linear trends.

Multivariable regression performs best when multiple factors are combined.

🔧 Future Work
Introduce more features (e.g., attendance, motivation level)

Try regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso)

Experiment with tree-based or ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)
